Lab 1

LAB Program:

Write a Java Program that will collect an employee's basic details that fall into different data types and displays them.
After the details have been displayed, with the help of conditional statements, check if the gender of the employee is 'm' or 'f'. It should print "MALE" for 'm' and "FEMALE" for 'f'.
Assume that you can divide the states among India into different regions (North, South, Central, East, and West). If the employee is from the southern part of India, with the help of a switch statement, it should display "The Employee is from the southern states of India; Preferable work location is in <state>", along with the basic details.
Identify if the employee belongs to the top MNC Companies (Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Samsung, IBM, Apple); if so, print a message "The employee is working in Top MNC Companies".

Note: Your program should be neatly organized, with appropriate comments, variable names, proper input output formatting, and necessary validations.
